 # C++ Programming on Linux 

Using Qt Creator IDE Cross Platform Application and UI Framework


// writting C++ program on linux environment directly through Qt creator a GUI ( grapical user interface ), Qt Creator is a IDE 

Note :: We have to install Qt creator on Linux envitonment 

Write in terminal :: go to terminal wite qtcreator

//Qt creator GUI is open   

	Qt creator is open click on Files then select new project then choose Non-Qt Project and Plain C++ Application then click on choose
	
		Files ---> new project ---> Non-Qt Project ---> Plain C++ Application ---> choose

	Then we choose the location of project frome Browse and give project name 

		we create new floder which is our project working directory in which our project  subdirectory 

	Then we choose defeault build system qmake the next 

	Kit section select the Desktop Qt 6.9.1 then click on next 

	Add to version control : None 

	click on finish


	now select the build Debug or Release  from  left - bottom corner side in Qt creator

	now build click on hummer button on  left - bottom corner side in Qt creator 

	Build is green means Success

	Build is red means Error 

//Qt creator GUI is close


myQtTest.pro file in which there is our environment set up

Sources directory there is our main.cpp program file

Qt creator as created as default Hello World! program

 
// Example::

Project 
  |
  |____myQtTest
  	   |
	   |____myQtTest.pro
	   |
	   |____Sources
		  |
		  |____main.cpp			


 

//Now come to linux terminal

Example::

..../shubham> ls -l
Day_2

..../shubham> cd Day_2

..../shubham/Day_2> ls -l
Debug
myQtTest
Release

..../shubham/Day_2> cd Debug
..../shubham/Day_2/Debug> ls -l
main.o
Makefile
myQtTest ----------> Binary file (Executable)

..../shubham/Day_2> cd Release
..../shubham/Day_2/Release> ls -l
main.o
Makefile
myQtTest ----------> Binary file (Executable)


..../shubham/Day_2> cd myQtTest
..../shubham/Day_2/myQtTest> ls -l
main.cpp
myQtTest.pro
myQtTest.pro.user

// What is Difference between Debug and Release 

Debug : contain three files same as Releas but Debug take more memory for executable then Release, it is use during development of project  

Release : contain three files same as Debug but Release take less memory executable then Debug , it is use completion of project

Debug : size of executable (binary file) is more because it allow as to debug (make changes in projects)  the executable , Executable is a binary file of program  

Release : size of executable(binary file) is less because it don't allow as to debug (make changes in projects)  the executable  , Executable is a binary file of program , it is a final executable
