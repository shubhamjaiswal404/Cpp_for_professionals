# C++ Programming on Linux -1 

Using Linux terminal command mode 


// printing Hello world 

we are running program directly on command line 
specifie main function that return integer which is zero 

std::cout --> it is a standard cout device which is already specify in under header file #include<iostream>

std::endl --> it is a standard end of line puts the cursor to next line or jumps to next line  which is also specify in under header file #include<iostream>


Hello.cpp is program compile by command :: g++ Hello.cpp -o Hello

g++ is complier use to compile Hello.cpp program 

-o Hello means generate output as birnary file name as Hello which is also called as executable

Executable or binary file Hello can  be directly run on command line ./Hello


// printing received arguments from command line 

# int main() {

in main function we haven't specify any parameter , it means this program is not receiving over ignored all argument from command line 



# int main( int argv , char* argv[] ) {


so in order our program is able to receive arguments from command line we have to specify two parametrs

int argc 
first parameter specify integer value argc , argc is the total argument we receive from command line and 

char* argv[] 
second parameter is char* ( char pointer ) which will point to each individual argument we receive from command line  

now lets print these two parametrs 

Example 1::
 ..../shubham> ./Hello 

argc = 1 , argv[] = ./Hello


Example 2::
 ..../shubham> ./Hello arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4

argc = 5 , argv[] = ./Hello , arg1 , arg2 , arg3 , arg4 .
